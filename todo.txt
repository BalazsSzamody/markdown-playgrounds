- [ ] Link checker
- [ ] Come up with a good (defined) scheme for fence names

- [ ] "Halt on Error" checkmark menu item that halts when an error happens
- [ ] Have multiple "sessions" within a file
- [ ] Search (and replace)
- [ ] Have an (optional?) clickable outline-view of the document on the left-hand-side of the splitview.
- [ ] Parse yaml preamble?
- [ ] Allow for a way to have "rich" results. Maybe we could do something with HTML?
